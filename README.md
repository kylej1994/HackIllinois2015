HackIllinois 2015 Submission
Our Project was called RoomieConnect. Essentially we wanted to centralize the roommate experience, much like a virtual post-it note, so that all roommates in an apartment can easily access and be notified of their chores, and pay each other back for bills and small favors. 


It was developed in javaScript, and won 2nd place for best use of Dwolla API at HackIllinois.
Developed by Kyle Jablon, Sam Baugh, Daryl Halima, and Abhishek Somanath.
